## Introduction

OpenBSD is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system based on the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). It emphasizes security, code correctness, and code simplicity. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for users looking to install OpenBSD and understand its system calls.

## Installation Guide

### System Requirements

Before you start the installation, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Processor**: x86, ARM, or other supported architectures
- **RAM**: Minimum of 512 MB (1 GB recommended)
- **Disk Space**: At least 2 GB of free space
- **Network**: Optional but recommended for updates during installation

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the OpenBSD ISO**: Visit the [OpenBSD official website](https://www.openbsd.org/) to download the latest version.
2. **Create a Bootable USB**: Use tools like `dd` on Unix systems or Rufus on Windows to create a bootable USB drive.
3. **Boot from USB**: Insert the USB drive into your computer and boot from it. You may need to change your BIOS settings to prioritize USB boot.
4. **Follow the Installer**: The installer will guide you through the process. Pay attention to the prompts and choose options that suit your needs.
5. **Configure Network**: If you have an internet connection, the installer can fetch updates during installation.
6. **Finalize Installation**: Once the installation completes, reboot your system and remove the USB drive.

## System Calls Overview

### What are System Calls?

System calls provide an interface between user applications and the operating system. They allow programs to request services from the kernel, such as file operations, process management, and network communication.

### Common System Calls in OpenBSD

- **open()**: Opens a file and returns a file descriptor.
- **read()**: Reads data from a file descriptor.
- **write()**: Writes data to a file descriptor.
- **close()**: Closes an open file descriptor.
- **fork()**: Creates a new process.
- **exec()**: Executes a new program in the current process.

Understanding these system calls is crucial for developing applications on OpenBSD. You can explore their usage in the OpenBSD man pages.
