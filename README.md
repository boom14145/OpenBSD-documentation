# OpenBSD Documentation
## Installation Overview
Installation of the operating system was done using simple, step-by-step guides. Core tasks like storage and user account setup were performed through default configurations. Installation was easy and proceeded simply. Short guides allowed rapid installation completion.
## System Call Implementation
madvise() system call was employed to test kernel-space memory hints. This helped to get a close experience with system-level programming. Everything was tested within the virtual machine. The experience was beneficial to learn hands-on things regarding UNIX-based system internals.
